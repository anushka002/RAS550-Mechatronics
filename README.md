## Overview

This repository contains the complete set of **lab assignments** completed as part of  
**RAS 550: Mechatronic Systems (Fall 2025 C)** at **Arizona State University**.

The labs focus on **hands-on implementation of mechatronic systems**, emphasizing the integration of:
- Embedded hardware (Arduino Uno)
- Sensors and actuators
- Real-time control
- MATLAB/Simulink-based modeling and deployment
- Experimental system analysis and validation

Together, these labs build a strong foundation in **open-loop and closed-loop control**, **motor and thermal systems**, and **signal processing**, directly supporting the course final project.

> ⚠️ Note: All lab assignments were completed as **team-based submissions**.
