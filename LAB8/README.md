## Lab 08 – Temperature Signal Filtering Using MATLAB and Simulink

### Description
This lab focuses on developing and implementing a **digital filter** in Simulink to smooth the temperature data collected from previous experiments. A higher-order **low-pass filter** is designed in MATLAB with a sampling time of **0.5 seconds** to attenuate measurement noise and improve signal quality. The filtered data allows for clearer observation of system behavior and more reliable control performance in future applications.

### Objectives
1. Utilize temperature data recorded from previous labs as the input signal for filtering.  
2. Design a higher-order low-pass filter in MATLAB with a specified sampling time of **0.5 s**.  
3. Implement the designed filter in Simulink to process and smooth the temperature data.  
4. Generate and analyze the **Bode plot** of the designed filter to evaluate its frequency response and filtering characteristics.

### Expected Outcome
By the end of this lab, students will gain hands-on experience in digital filter design and implementation using MATLAB and Simulink. The resulting filtered temperature signal should exhibit reduced noise, smoother trends, and improved suitability for closed-loop control or further data analysis.
